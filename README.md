# Erik Miller

Building software that matters. Infrastructure. Mobile. Full-Stack.

## WHAT I DO

I build systems that scale and mobile apps people actually use.
Backend architecture, cross-platform development, native solutions.

No fluff. Just code that works.

**Current focus:**
- Infrastructure & distributed systems
- Cross-platform mobile (Flutter)
- Native mobile development
- Full-stack architecture

**When offline:** Iron & discipline
